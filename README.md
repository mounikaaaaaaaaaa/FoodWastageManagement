Everyday people used to waste foods. In order to reduce that food wastage problem I planned to do this project. In this project the guest can login & enter their Location, amount of food and type of food available. Then a simple notification is given to the agent. After seeing the notification the agent among that location can login & can gather the details of the donor. The donor can hold an account in this application & whenever there is food wastage he can login and enter the details of food and location. The agent can also hold an account and can retrieve the details. After retrieving the details the agent can collect food from the donor and can redistribute to the orphans or others. This project is food redistribution is an enormously successful social innovation that tackles food waste and food poverty.
